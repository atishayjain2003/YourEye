# your_eye

Your Eye is a digital money transaction interface for the visually impaired people, embedded within an UPI linked application using Braille language.

This interface would help the visually impaired people to completely eliminate their dependency over a third person to make any sort of online transaction for them, as well as it will uproot any chance of stealing of their confidential banking related information.
